# Versatile

This is a very WIP C++ player character / controller for UE4 that I eventually hope to make into a template, addable component, or plugin.

The existing FPS and TPS templates that ship with UE4 are single-purpose. It requires a fair bit of work to add third-person support to the FPS template or to add first person support to the third person template.

The VersatileCharacter will be able to handle first player and several different forms of third player perspectives, as well as support for full-body first person and lerping between different points of view.

Most of that doesn't work yet, though. :)
