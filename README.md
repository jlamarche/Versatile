# Versatile

This is a very WIP C++ player character / controller for UE4 that I eventually hope to make into a template, addable component, or plugin.

The existing FPS and TPS templates that ship with UE4 are single-purpose. It requires a fair bit of work to add third-person support to the FPS template or to add first person support to the third person template.

The VersatileCharacter handles first player perspective and a couple different variants of third player perspective. It also supports full-body first person.
